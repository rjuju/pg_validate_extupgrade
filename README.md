pg_validate_extupgrade
======================

Tool to validate PostgreSQL extension upgrade script.

Usage
-----

```
USAGE:
    pg_validate_extupgrade [OPTIONS] --extname <extname> --from <from> --to <to>

FLAGS:
        --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -d, --dbname <dbname>      database name
    -e, --extname <extname>    extension to test
    -c, --config <filename>    configuration file name.  Supported extension: .toml and .json
        --from <from>          initial version of the extension
    -h, --host <host>          database server host or socket directory
    -p, --port <port>          database server port
        --to <to>              upgraded version of the extension
    -U, --user <user>          database user name
```

Note that the connection parameters default follow the same rules as PostgreSQL
official client.

Configuration file
------------------

All options that can provided in the command line can also be instead retrieved
from a configuration file, which can be specific using the `-c | --config`
option.  If an option is present both in the configuration file and in the
command line, the command line version will be used.

2 formats can be used for the configuration file: [TOML](https://toml.io/en/)
and [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html).  The format is automatically
detected using the configuration file name extension (respectively **.toml**
and **.json**), and an error will be raised if the format can't be detected or
if the content is incorrect.

On top of the existing options, the configuration file can also accept some
optional options:

- **extra_queries**:  This is an array of string, specifying a
                      list of queries to run after the extension installation
                      and upgrade, that can be used to validate the data
                      generated by the extension scripts.  The queries will be
                      executed sequentially in the order they appear in the
                      configuration file, each in a sub-transaction that will
                      get rollbacked each time.  Any difference in the result
                      sets will be reported with the rest of the possible
                      problems.

- **pre_upgrade_queries**: This is an array of string, specifying a list of
                           queries to run just before upgrading the extension
                           to the new version and that won't be rollbacked.  It
                           can be used to make sure that some data are present
                           to hit some more code path during the extension
                           ugprade.  Any error during the execution will exit
                           pg_validate_extupgrade with an error code 1.

Here are some example of such configuration files.

  * TOML

```
extname = 'pg_broken_extupgrade'
from = 'head-1.0'
to = 'head-1.1'
extra_queries = [
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'dump_0'"
]
```

  * JSON

```
{
    "extname": "pg_broken_extupgrade",
    "from": "head-1.0",
    "to": "head-1.1",
    "extra_queries": [
        "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'dump_0'"
    ]
}
```

The result of the queries will be of the form:

```
field_name: value
[...]
```

It makes it easier to locate inconsistencies in the generated diff.

Note that you're responsible for writing sensible queries.  For instance, those
should only refer to objects created by the extension, should not modify data
and should have consistent results across multiple execution and/or
environments.

Only the main data types (bool, integer, float, text...) are supported, and
some data types are not supported on purpose (for instance time and timestamps
as those are quite likely to contain unstable data).  If you use an unsupported
datatype, you will get all the required details in the output to fix the
situation.  You have 2 ways for that:

- explicitly cast the column to text in your queries
- open an issue to ask for supporting this datatype

Compilation
-----------

You need the Rust toolchain, including `cargo` and `rustc`.

I recommend using your distribution packages, for instance:

- on Debian/Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt install cargo
```

- on RHEL 7:

```
sudo yum install rust-toolset-1.31
```

- on RHEL 8:

```
sudo yum module install rust-toolset
```

If your distribution doesn't provide the required packages, you can look at
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for an alternative way to get the
toolchain.

Once you're good, you simply need to compile the binary:

```
$ cd /path/to/pg_validate_extupgrade
$ cargo build --release
   Compiling pg_validate_extupgrade v1.0.0-beta (/home/rjuju/git/pg_validate_extupgrade)
    Finished release [optimized] target(s) in 19.09s
```

The binary will be available in `./target/release/pg_validate_extupgrade`.

You can refer to the [Cargo
documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html) for
more information about the `cargo build` command.

If you hit a bug, you can instead compile a debug version of the tool omitting
the **--release** option:

```
* cargo build
```

The binary will then be available in `./target/debug/pg_validate_extupgrade`.

You can then execute the tool again, asking for a more detailed backtrace:

```
$ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/debug/pg_validate_extupgrade -e ...
```

Feel free to open an issue with the reported backtrace!

Example
-------

Here is the output of the tool when used with the `pg_broken_extupgrade`
extension provided in the test/ directory:

```
# build a debug version of the tool
$ cargo build

# build the test extension (requires postgres headers)
$ make -C tests/fixtures install

# test the tool
$ ./target/debug/pg_validate_extupgrade -c tests/fixtures/pg_broken_extupgrade.toml
